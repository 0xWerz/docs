This was the original repo that the Astro docs site was built for. On July 15, 2021 the docs site was launched: https://docs.astro.build/

The docs site was eventually merged into the main Astro repo. You can now find it here: https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro/tree/main/docs

This repo has been archived and is no longer maintained. It is kept around as a historical artifact and for sentimental reasons :)
