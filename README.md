# Astro Docs Working Group <img width="19.2" height="25.6" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowpackjs/astro/main/assets/brand/logo.svg" alt="Astro logo">

This was the original repo that contained the Astro docs site while it was under heavy development. On July 15, 2021 the docs site was launched: https://docs.astro.build/

The docs site was eventually merged into the main Astro repo. You can now find it here: https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro/tree/main/docs

This repo has been archived and is no longer maintained. It is kept around as a historical artifact and for sentimental reasons :)
