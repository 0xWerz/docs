## What is Astro?

**Astro** is a _fresh but familiar_ approach to building websites. Astro combines decades of proven performance best practices with the DX improvements of the component-oriented era.

With Astro, you can use your favourite JavaScript framework and automatically ship the bare-minimum amount of JavaScript‚Äîby default, which is preferably none at all!

## Project Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Astro is still an early beta, missing features and bugs are to be expected!**

If you can stomach it, then Astro-built sites are production ready. There are several production websites already built with Astro existing in the wild right now <!-- I think we should include a few links to a couple of astro sites, like snowpack.dev-->.

- [Snowpack.dev](https://www.snowpack.dev)

As we get closer to launching Astro `v.1.0` we will be updating this section with more information. You can stay in touch by following us on Twitter [@astrodotbuild](https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild) or joining us on our own [Discord channel](https://t.co/oD9FVTRY9E?amp=1)

## üîß Quick Start

> __Important__: Astro is built with [ESM modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) which are not supported in older version of Node.js. The minimum supported version of Nodejs is __14.16.1__.

```bash
# create your project
mkdir new-project-directory
cd new-project-directory
npm init astro || yarn add astro

# install your dependencies
npm install || yarn

# start the dev server and open your browser
npm start || yarn start
```

### üöÄ Build & Deployment

The default Astro project has the following `scripts` in the `/package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "astro dev",
    "build": "astro build"
  }
}
```

For local development, run:

```
npm run start
```

To build for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

To deploy your Astro site to production, upload the contents of `/dist` to your favorite static site host.
